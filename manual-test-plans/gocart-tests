Expedited checkout:

    Load /pay/ for 'scotttest'
    Use 'scott@plugnpay.com' in the email address field
    To test different scenarios, in /private/processors.cgi change settings and test:

a) Auto - entering email address should open gocart window if gocart template is used (no other template used)

    if another template is used, gocart window should not open after email is entered

b) Off - entering email address should never open gocart window
c) On - entering email address should always open gocart window, no matter what template is used

    Also test the above by passing the same email address to /pay/

Amount:

    Load /pay/ without passing an amount, enter an amount on the page and use the gocart button, amount should be same as entered

Enrollment checkbox:

    Use enrollment setting in processor.cgi to render the enrollment checkbox and view it on /pay/
