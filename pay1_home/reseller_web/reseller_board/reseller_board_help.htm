  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>The online reseller FAQ is an interactive interface which helps locate answers to commonly asked questions, issues & problems.  This interface will assist you in integration, problem solving, and addressing your issues in a fast, efficient manner.
      <p>The online FAQ provides users the ability to search our database of frequently asked questions in 3 ways:
      <br><ol>
        <li> View all questions within a given category
        <li> Search by keywords or key phrases
        <li> Search by a specific question's identification number
      </ol>

      <p>Most searches are generally performed via a combination of keywords &/or key-phrases.  This provides the easiest way to retrieve questions, by matching your specific search criteria.

      <br><ul>
        <li><b>Keywords</b> are singular words that best describe what you are looking to find/match. (e.g. "return", "void", "batch")
        <li><b>Key Phrases</b> are specific consecutive words or phrases you want to match. (e.g. "transaction administration", "credit card", "assemble batch")
      </ul>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>When entering multiple keywords &/or key phrases, separate the search terms via a ', ' [comma space] or '; ' [semi-colon space].

      <p>Search results may be further refined by excluding certain words, searching within a specific category &/or by selecting a minimum percentage that must be met in order for the FAQ to show the matching question.

      <p>If you wish to exclude keywords or key phrases, put a "-" [hyphen] in front of each keyword or key phrase you wish to exclude.  (e.g. "test, mode, -sentinel")

      <p><ul>
        <b>For Best Results:</b>
        <li>Search on several short, simple words (e.g. "void, return, credit").
        <li>Try not to search on plural words (e.g. "voids, returns, credits")
        <li>Use partial words for greater matching ability (e.g. entering "auth" to match "authentication", "authorization", "authorizations", "authorize", "authorizing", etc.)
        <li>Split key phrases into separate keywords (e.g. switch "void transaction" to "void, transaction")
      </ul>

      <p>If your query results in too many matches:
      <br><ul>
        <li>Redefine your minimum match percentage
        <li>Add excluding keywords to your search criteria
        <li>Search within a specific category
      </ul>

      <p>If your query results in few or no matches:
      <br><ul>
        <li>Add additional keywords or key phrases
        <li>Split key phrases into separate keywords (e.g. switch "void transaction" to "void, transaction")
        <li>Remove excluding keywords
        <li>Search all available categories
        <li>Use simpler keywords
      </ul>

      <p>Searching on plural words in many cases will reduce the number of likely matches.  The FAQ's search engine performs simple pattern matching to handle searches; as such, the search engine is able to perform partial matches on search terms (including excluded keywords & key phrases).  The search engine works best with several small, simple words.  Keep this in mind when performing queries.
